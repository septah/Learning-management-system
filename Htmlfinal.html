                <h2></h2>
                <h4 id="tekst">Countless countries, Norway among them, uphold the fundamental principle of the right to equal education for everyone. Some children do, however, have a harder time getting through elementary (and possibly higher education) than others. This is the case with many people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. A lot of children with ASD have limited options when it comes to their education and are either limited to the options of going to schools for children with special needs, where waitinglists are often long, or attend regular schools with classrooms of up to 30 people at once. Failure in adapting public schools for this specific challenge might result in limited social training for high-functional autistic children, training which potentially could simplify the transition into adulthood, as well as increased costs for the state. </h4>
                <h2>The autism diagnosis and the problems that may arise in a school setting</h2>
                <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder. The characteristics of the disorder is difficulty in communication and interaction with other people, restricted interests, and symptoms that hurt the person’s ability to function properly in the daily life.<a href="#reference1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> A child is often diagnosed before reaching the age of five. </p>
                <p>Seeing as social situations are difficult for people with autism, a classroom can be a very challenging environment for the child. Autism is often linked to sensory dysfunction<a href="#reference2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, which means sensitivity to noises, bright lights and other sensory inputs. People with autism are also often very dependent on routines and schedules, and are often overwhelmed when these are changed. These issues combined may result in the child acting out, screaming and throwing things  and acting aggressively. Because of these cited problems a lot of the time the child is pulled out of the normal classroom. The child will often have 1-on-1 contact with an assistant at these times, but will have restricted opportunities of teacher-pupil time. By taking into account the extra challenges an autistic child faces when learning to read, write and connect and sort information. This is obviously not ideal.
                The educational environment in our schools is not accessible for everyone, and it can be the most difficult aspect of the child’s life.
                </p>
                <p>Our wish is to present a solution which we think might lessen the burden of making it through public school for people diagnosed with autism disorder.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Anecdotal reports <a href="#reference3" target="_blank"><sup>[3]</sup></a> suggest that children with autism often have an affinity for screen-based activities. We wanted to make it easier to implement specific learning resources adapted for children, as well as lessening the strain children with autism have to go through on a typical school day, specifically in regards to social interaction, and have therefore made a website specific for students with autism to be used in schools.</p>
                <h2>Market Survey</h2>
                <p>In order to research the need for such a website and to ask for help in specific design suggestions we sent out mail a mail to both Utdanningsforskning and Autismeforbundet: </p>
                <blockquote>Hei, vi er 5 studenter på OsloMet som har bestemt oss for å tenke ut en online læringsplattform for å hjelpe læringssituasjonen til barn med autisme. Det skal være mulighet for å bli brukt på mobil og Ipad/nettbrett  Grunnet de utfordringer disse barna møter I et vanlig klasserom tenkte vi at en plattform som er spesialtilpasset dette formålet er noe det kanskje kunne vært behov for. Vi har derfor noen spørsmål vi håper dere kan hjelpe oss å svare på:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Er en online læringsplattform for barn med autisme noe dere tror det er behov for?</li>
                    <li>Er det noe innen forskningen som vi bør være påpasselig med når vi skal utvikle en slik plattform?</li>
                    <li>Kunne dere ha pekt oss i retning av noen relevante forskningsartikler angående autisme og online læringsmetoder?</li>
                  </ul>
                  Jeg håper virkelig at dere har lyst til å hjelpe oss med oppgaven og setter stor pris på svar.</blockquote>
                <p>From Utdanningsforskning we received the answer: </p>
                <blockquote>Hei, takk for interessen.



                Vi kan dessverre ikke hjelpe der med de to første spørsmålene, selv om jeg vet at det alltid er etterspørsel etter gode digitale verktøy i undervisningssektoren, men dere vil kanskje finne noe av interesse i artiklene vi har samlet i temakategorien «autisme» på sidene våre:

                I tillegg kan jeg anbefale denne artikkelen om ADHD, hvor det presenteres noen digitale verktøy i ADHD-behandling. Kanskje det er noe inspirasjon å finne der?

                Lykke til i arbeidet deres.</blockquote>
                <p>and as for Autismeforbundet a helpful lady answered back:</p>
                <q>Hei , jeg kommer til å å videresende mailen din til styret også hører du fra oss;

                  Godt initiativ:) </q>

                <p>Sadly the board of Autismeforbundet didn't respond to us in time, but we found both responses to be encouraging in terms of the need for our solution.</p>

                <h2>Specific Features Adapted for Children with ASD</h2>
                <h3>Social Stories</h3>
                <p>Social stories have shown promising results in correcting unwanted behaviors. Social stories<sup>TM</sup> were created by Carol Gray in 1991. They are short descriptions of a particular situation, event or activity, which include specific information about what to expect in that specific situation and why<a href="#reference4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. We wish to implement a solution that makes it easy for teachers to create social stories for each student concerning their more problematic behavior in order to prevent reoccurence and help the child adapt well to social situations. These stories can then be presented to the student with a frequency that the teacher sets. Each student can have multiple social stories for them to go through each day.
                </p>
                <h3>Language Comprehension</h3>
                <p>In our day to day life we use a figurative language, full of images and metaphors. This is something that many people with autism have a hard time comprehending. Because of these difficulties in grasping figurative language, it is quite common for people with autism to isolate themselves, because they do not understand the conversations they otherwise engage in. Studies have shown that metaphors are what they find the most challenging. We therefore wanted to implement a comprehensive learning resource to aid these students in becoming more confident in understanding, and even using, figurative language.
                </p>
                <h3>Safe Space</h3>
                <p>Transitions are one of the things that people with autism respond less well to. Transitions happen everyday at school from one class to another, and from one task to the next. Often, a child prone to reacting to these things at school will become overwhelmed while interacting with peers in group settings, walking down a busy hallway, or eating in a noisy lunchroom. If things aren’t predictable or the transition for the student is harder than on other days the child might experience a meltdown.</p>
                <p>Meltdowns often occur when unexpected things happen at school. Teachers know their students and can easily see if it is happening, but not always the student itself.
                  If a meltdown occurs, a teacher may create a safe space that can include beanbags, calming games, such as puzzles, stress balls, or relaxing music.
                </p>
                <p>This is why we also wanted to make our own alternative safe space so the children afflicted can be able to escape the environment that has caused anxiety or discomfort, easily accessible to the student without involvement from an otherwise engaged teacher. The safe space can be a helpful
                tool in addition to stress-relieving gadgets.</p>
                <h3>Timetable with To-Do-List</h3>
                <p>As previously mentioned, students with autism respond very well to well-organized conditions. Structure and consistency are key.
                  We have implemented a timetable with an easily editable to-do-list set by teachers for the individual student, limiting the uneasiness that might result from the child not knowing what might happen next. For each subject the student will get specific goals and tasks.
                </p>
                <h3>Visual Aid for Mood and Emotion</h3>
                <p>Another use for our online-based system is to help the students express themselves. A lot of people on the autism spectrum find using oral (and sometimes written) language to express feelings or ideas difficult. There are visual aids, such as cards, widely used for this purpose<a href="#reference5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>.
                  Translating these “emotion cards” to the digital world allows the student to select their own images for the different feelings (much in the same way emoticons are used). We think that this might be good for students with an especially narrow interest field (for example animal based visual aids for students who really love animals - a common fascination among girls with ASD). Digital emotion cards also have the advantage of not being corporeal and therefore cannot be
                  destroyed or thrown (at people) during tantrums.</p>
                <h3>Teacher/student-chat</h3>
                <p>With an active chat on the side, the pupil will be able to talk to her assistant and teacher if the child wishes to or needs to. This feature is also an excellent way for the teacher to follow up on the student when he/she is taken out of class.
                </p>
                <h3>Week Plan</h3>
                <p>We have also chosen to implement a week plan in our design to make it easy for the student to have access to information about what’s planned for the entire week, hopefully assisting in alleviating the student’s anxiety levels.</p>

              <h2></h2>
              <p>Henriette is an 8 year old girl diagnosed with autism. She made it through her first years of public school staying unusually quiet, letting others speak for her and doing her best to stay out of peoples’ hairs. This has become increasingly difficult as the years have gone by as people have started to develop faster than her, using a more varied language and voicing their feelings in a more advanced manner. Henriette also dreads the aspect of attending school more, seeing as she has trouble grasping the rapidly developing social demands set by other pupils while managing the chaotic noises and sights and the changing schedules of the classroom. As a result she has been experiencing more epileptic (a fairly common symptom for especially girls diagnosed with autism<a href="#reference6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>) and/or panic episodes, and often has to leave the classroom entirely for something more quiet.
              </p>
              <p>Henriette is very fascinated with trains. She feels that trains are easier to understand than other people and are fun to ride.</p>
              <p>We have developed our prototype with Henriette in mind, but is easily adaptable by teacher and student to suit any high-functioning autistic children, with a selection of themes commonly enjoyed by groups with very specific interests and the option of creating your own theme for pupils whose interests are even more specific.</p>
              <p>In order to design a program for Henriette, applicable to others with ASD as well, there are things we have chosen to focus on. Firstly, we know kids diagnosed with autism have problems communicating with other people. Some kids are verbal and some are non verbal. Many autistic people also have a hard time maintaining eye contact with others. Being able to work with a computer/pad -based school-program for Henriette would therefore hopefully make her schoolday a bit easier.

              <div>
                <h3>Sign In</h3>
                <p>The sign in page is used to make sensitive information regarding the students safe. A realistic plan for this feature is to use Feide’s platform for optimized security.</p>
                <p>The site should be personalized for students, but not necessarily individuals, seeing as the page is meant to be used by students all over the country, and to limit the need for teachers to worry about this particular element.
                </p>
                <h3>Visual aid for mood and emotion</h3>
                <p>We have added a mood-button on our prototype-website that accesses a range of emotion-cards available for the less vocal student. Our thought is that this will be instantly sent to the teacher for when he/she is otherwise unavailable and easily read and interpreted by teacher-assistants.</p>
                <p>We chose to implement a train based mood-expressor, catering to Henriette’s specific interest. Our wish is for this to be easily adaptable by teachers, specifically suited for the individual student and their needs.
                </p>
                <h3>Language Comprehension</h3>
                <p>The feature we have showcased gives an example of how an interactive lesson in language comprehension could take place, consisting of a PPT presentation with multiple slides of examples of idiomatic expressions. The teacher or TA could benefit from using this type of digital tool to make learning more fun and interactive. The pupil will try to understand the expression by reading and looking at the images, followed by group discussions and solving tasks independently. The teacher should be certain that the language in the tasks given to the child should be on the reading level of the child so that the site is accessible.
                </p>
                <p>We believe this resource in the long run should include multiple ways of approaching this topic, ideally by creating some relevant fun games, exercises and etc.
                </p>
                <h3>Timetable</h3>
                <p>Every page (with the exception of the Safe Space) is equipped with a timetable with a plan for the day, hopefully limiting the unrest the child experiences by not knowing what’s going to happen next.
                </p>
                <p>The pupil will then have the option of checking off each item on the to-do-list when completed, earning praise every time. The aspect of praise is among the many things where the opinion of children with autism don’t differ from children without autism; (almost) all very much appreciate it and are motivated by it. Moreover, research have shown that strategies involving reinforcements are effective when wanting to improve the behavior of people with autism
                  <a href="#reference7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.
                </p>
                <p>In addition, by including a “done”-button it would be easy to implement a way for an absent teacher to be notified when the student has completed his or her task.</p>
                <h3>Social Stories</h3>
                <p>It has been shown that pictures and videos can complement the social story strategy, so our solution aims to have an easy way to include this. This has not yet been implemented in our prototype, but is something we would very much like to include in the finished product. The story making process will be easy for the teacher to understand and to update. There will be guidelines for the teacher to follow when creating a story and the site will also include some premade stories involving common classroom situations. If images are used these should have a good explanation of what is depicted. If the teacher chooses to use videos, they should be captioned as well as have extended audio descriptions.
                </p>
                <p>We have implemented a few short Social Stories in our prototype as an example of what we are attempting to do, with a reward system for completing the stories of the day.
                </p>
                <h3>Safe Space</h3>
                <p>The screen-based safe space implemented in the prototype is intended to be fully customizable to suit the individual child’s needs. The Safe Space site can be anything that makes the student calm down, from VR/AR or just as easy something as simple as watching a train go by, like in Henriette’s case.</p>
                <p>VR/AR has the advantage of giving the child the option of shutting out all other visual impulses and immersing themselves in a platform outside of the realm of noisy and active fellow students.
                </p>
                <p>Furthermore, the benefits of using virtual reality (VR) interventions are highlighted in recent research<a href="#reference8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>,
                in which individuals with ASD can practice difficult or individually challenging social interactions in a less-anxiety producing platform.
                A recent study<a href="#reference9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> also shows that cognitive behaviour therapy techniques in an immersive virtual reality environment can be highly effective for the treatment of specific phobias/fears for some people with ASD.</p>
                <p>In addition to VR-headsets the students can be supplied with noise-canceling headsets in order to escape the outside world completely.
                </p>
                <p>We want the SafeSpace function to be able to be designed and adapted by the user, in combination with teacher, if they want to, seeing as the interests of people diagnosed with autism are varied and many. Different things will also relax different children, so we feel it is important to keep the child’s individual needs in mind when creating the safe space. In addition, we plan for the program to include some standard options that are typical for people with autism to calm down to.
                </p>
                <p>Providing a safe space for people suffering from autism when they are feeling anxious or overwhelmed can be very helpful. It is, however, important to keep in mind that a safe space should not be used as a regular solution to anxiety. Rather, it should be used only when needed during extreme situations of duress. If a safe space is overused it could become a way to escape daily life and activities in fear of anxiety triggers, which is not our intention. In order to limit the use of this function, as well as keeping the teacher informed, we therefore also plan to have the teacher receive an instant notification whenever the child enters the safe space.</p>
                <h3>Chat</h3>
                <p>In the chat we want the student to be able to choose if they want to write with words or with emojis in the way they would want to express themselves. These emojis should also be adaptable for the individual student should the teacher and child wish it (for instance happy/sad/angry train).
                </p>
                <p>In the future we would also like to implement a button for the teacher to pause notifications from the chat/temporarily block student if the child is hindering the teaching of other students.
                </p>
                <p>Our design for the chat-window is limited by our restricted knowledge of coding. Due to privacy-considerations we would like this aspect of the web-page to be based on peer-to-peer communication with the teacher, limiting the chance of sensitive information being released. We have been informed by a source bound by a confidentiality agreement that chats by third parties are being extensively used for communication by teacher/students with ASD in schools today, which is quite foreboding.
                </p>
                <p>The chat window is not available for use on mobile phones due to restricted screen space. JavaScript would enable us to make the chat window pop up and down at the user’s request, but would limit responsivity with JavaScript enabled.</p>
                <h3>Week Plan</h3>
                <p>The week plan will be easily editable for both student and teacher with the option of adding elements to the homework and school-assignments.</p>
                <h2>Visual Design and Accessibility</h2>
                <p>Our wish, design-wise, has been to create something that’s visually appealing as well being non-stressful, while at the same time being intuitive and easy to use for colorblind-people.
                  We have chosen colors that are pleasant for most people to look at. Light blues are our main color, keeping colorblind people in mind. According to a renowned psychologist<a href="#reference10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
                  light pastels are also a preferable color scheme for people with ASD as this restricts sensory overload. Furthermore, we want it to be an available option for the teacher to choose the color-scheme of the interface if there is a specific color that is prefered by the user. The colour scheme maintains a 7:1 contrast ratio for the text and background to ensure readability.
                </p>
                <p>If the child has a special interest of some kind, like trains in Henriette’s case, we want it to be an option to choose a special theme for the interface. We were thinking of adding a few standard themes common among people with ASD like rockets, videogame-figures, cartoon-heroes, animals etc.
                </p>
                <p>We want this to be an inclusive and well workable program for the user itself, as well as for the teacher and assistant. It should be intuitive and enjoyable so it can make life a little easier at school and at work. This way the site can be something that will make the user want revisit it again and again.</p>
                <p>We have taken into consideration the many other forms of disabilities that may have the same need for a platform like the one we’ve created, which is why we might want the platform to be extended and become even more inclusive for those pupils/students with other kinds of disabilities in a school/learning environment in the future.</p>
                <p>Keeping in mind that our platform is meant for children and people with learning disabilities, we have strived to use a simple language without figurative elements which, as mentioned previously, can be difficult for our target group.</p>
                <p>Our wish is for our solution to comply with the WCAG 2.0. In order to accomplish this we have made deliberate design choices in our development and design. Since we only have developed a prototype we haven’t had the opportunity to implement all the accessibility elements we would have wanted. We have made a resize text button on the top right corner which resize the normal sized text by 200%. This is in the perceivable category in the WCAG. We have included a descriptive “alt” text to all pictures. The safe space we have developed in this prototype is just proof of concept. If we would have developed further we would of course have thought about the audio control, seeing as no page should play sound automatically for more than 3 seconds without any way of pausing it. The same issue applies to the moving train. For all the links we have combined pictures with text so that visually impaired people easier can navigate our site.
                </p>
                <h3>Features for the Future</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>The optimization of the website for resolutions down to 1280/720, adapting for what most scools use today.</li>
                <li>Responsive design for Internet Explorer</li>
                <li>Improved adaptation for mobile phones</li>
                <li>Prototype of the teacher's interface</li>
                </ul>

                  <p>Like adults, all children in the world have the right to a private life<a href="#reference11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>.Yet, a higher level of protection is required when it comes to collecting personal data about children seeing as children are less aware of their rights and the consequences and risks of sharing data. Following the GDPR reform in 2018, rules on data protection have strengthened. The legislation introduces new rights for consent in which consent cannot be assumed and it must be given for personal information to be used. Any information addressed specifically to a child should be adapted to be easily accessible, using clear and simple language. For most online services, the consent of the parent or guardian is required in order to process a child’s personal data on the grounds of consent up to a certain age. (Article 8 and Recitals (38) and (58) of the GDPR).
                  </p>
                  <p>For future implementation of our digital service, it could be beneficial to use Feide delivered by Uninett to ensure secure access and sharing of data and personal information. Further recommendations to improve security online would involve strong authentication, data-processing agreements and risk assessment<a href="#reference12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>. In cases where access is possible through external network or student network, there ought to be a stronger authentication than username and password. The reason is that an employee such as a teacher or TA, is given access to personal information about very many children. If an unauthorised user manages to retrieve/brute-force a username and password, it will be possible to log on to the system from anywhere in the world at any time without encountering any obstacles. Strong authentication makes it significantly more difficult for unwanted people to get access to the system and is a measure for protecting sensitive information about children.

                    <p>Our philosophy has been structure and consistency by creating organized elements to ensure optimal user experience. The visual aspect has been a key point to ensure that the child can easily comprehend and independently navigate around the website. This has been done by consistently labelling the elements so they’re easy to find and use for further use.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Features</h2>
                    <h3>Weekly and daily timetable</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li>A timetable that includes essential information about specified goals/tasks for every lesson. Because a child with autism often has an intense desire to be aware of agenda's ahead of time, this feature can revoke the feeling of safety and predictability.
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Interactive chat</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li>The interactive chat remains a main element of the different sites of the program. The chat will not change position if the user is redirected to a new page. Effectively, the student will always have the opportunity to communicate directly, either through written messages, self-supplied images or emojis, with the teacher or TA.
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Safe Space</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>A calming page specifically adapted to the individual user based on their interests and needs. By clicking the link, the user is directed to a space where they can block out unwanted distractions from the outside environment and hopefully find peace. In Henriette’s case, the feature has been specifically designed with choices made just for her based on her interest in trains.
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Social Stories</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>A page with stories where the child reads and writes about specific situations that might arise in the educational environment to make them reflect on their own behavior. Should be updated daily and contain elements such as short videos, clips and pictures for a visual understanding of the matter.
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Responsive design</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Our program should be able to be used on different types of screens. The Norwegian school system already makes great use of iPads and tablets at school, so this would be a point to take note of. The most important factor is that all children should have the ability to use the program regardless of electronic device type. Ideally, the pupil should also have the opportunity to also make use of the program outside of school.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>In conclusion</h2>
                    <h4>Every child up to 18 have the same rights, with or without disabilities. They should have equal opportunities to learn, to communicate and interact in an educational environment. We believe our platform will be a helpful tool in enabling these vulnerable children to reach their maximum potential.
